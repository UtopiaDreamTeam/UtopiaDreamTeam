👋 Hi, I’m @UtopiaDreamTeam and I'm a self-taught programmer.
I've loved coding and computers since I was a kid. Now I do it as a hobby.

👀 I’m interested in desktop, web apps, web api, mobile, and game development using dotNet.
🌱 I’m currently learning C# and dotNet.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any sort of small projects(or maybe medieum size ones).
📫 You can reach me at utopiadreamteam@gmail.com.
